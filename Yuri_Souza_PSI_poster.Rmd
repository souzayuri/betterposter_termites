# Introduction
Campos de Murundus, or earthmounds, are discrete mounds surrounded by grass common throughout the Brazilian Savanna. Such sites favor colonization both by plants and by termites¹, which play a major role in ecosystem dynamics and maintenance through organic matter decomposition and greenhouse gases emission ². Termites have been suggested as the engineered of the Murundus structure and even so we lack information regarding its ecological contribution. 

# Objectives
In my project I want to address how *Campos de murundus* and termites drive vegetation differentiation and gas emissions in a spatial gradient by investigating the following:

**1.** How do termite species composition and diversity vary within and outside the Murundus?

**2.** What are the mechanisms driving soil structure and nutrient composition by termite assemblages?

**3.** How are changes in soil components affecting plants' functional diversity?

**4.** Is termite activity within the Murundus affecting CH4 and CO2 emission rates?

# Methods

This experiment will be performed in the Brazilian Savanna **Cerrado**. Our sample design consists of termites and soil sample collections in a spatial gradient into and around the Murundus structures. After collecting our samples, we will investigate how these variables affect plant functional diversity and greenhouse gases emission. 

# Hypothesis

We hypothesize the existence of a gradient of termite diversity, soil nutrient enrichment, plant functional composition, and greenhouse gas fluxes increasing from an open grass field of the Savanna to the Murundus. Thus, we expect the Murundus to be tiny ecological islands for species composition and ecosystem processes such as nutrient turnover.
